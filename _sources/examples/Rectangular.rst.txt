Scenario I: Rectangular source
------------------------------
In this scenario we will explore the parameter space of a Rectangular Source [Okada1985]_ for the L'aquila 2009 earthquake.
It is up to the user to decide, which data is going to be used in the optimization, teleseismic waveforms and/or geodetic data.

The geodetic data consists of two static displacements data sets from the 06.04.2009 Mw6.3 L'Aquila earthquake. The data are InSAR displacement maps from ascending
and descending orbits.
The data has been pre-processed with `kite <https://github.com/pyrocko/kite>`__. For details on the use and data display we refer to the tutorial on the website.

.. image:: ../_static/scenario1/Laquila_asc.png

The seismic data consists of teleseismic waveforms of 35 stations that have been restituted to displacement, rotated to RTZ and downsampled to 2.5 Hz.


Clone project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To copy the scenario (including the data) to a directory outside of the package source directory, please edit the '&beat_models_path' and depending on which datatypes you want to use in the optimization fill the datatypes argument. For both datatypes (if only selected datatypes are of interest please delete either)::

   cd /path/to/beat/data/examples/
   beat clone Rectangular $beat_models_path/Laquila --datatypes=seismic,geodetic --copy_data

This will create a BEAT project directory named 'Laquila' with a configuration file (config_geometry.yaml) and an example dataset.
 - If your datatypes list included "geodetic" real Envisat InSAR data (geodetic_data.pkl) will be copied.
 - If "seismic" was included in the datatypes list, teleseismic waveforms, real data from 35 stations will be copied to seismic_data.pkl

Please change to your &beat_models_path with::

   cd $beat_models_path


Calculate Greens Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We need to calculate a Greens function (GF) store, as done in `Scenario 0 <https://hvasbath.github.io/beat/examples.html#calculate-greens-functions>`__
the regional Full Moment Tensor example.
Depending on the datatypes you selected earlier you will have to calculate the Greens Functions for both or either datatypes.

Geodetic
========
In this case we will calculate a Greens Function store that holds static displacements. For this we will make use of the PSGRN/PSCMP [Wang2008]_ backend.
You will need to install the respective executables if not done yet! Please follow this `link <https://hvasbath.github.io/beat/installation.html#greens-functions>`__ to do so.

Please open $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml with any text editor (e.g. vi) and search for: store_superdir.
The path specified here needs to be replaced with the path to where the GFs are supposed to be stored on your computer.
This directory is referred to as the $GF_path in the rest of the text. It is strongly recommended to use a separate directory
apart from the beat source directory. The statics Green's function stores are not very large, but could be re-used by several projects in the
future.

In the $project_path/config_geometry.yaml under geodetic_config we find the gf_config, which holds the major parameters for GF calculation::

 gf_config: !beat.GeodeticGFConfig
   store_superdir: $project_directory/
   reference_model_idx: 0
   n_variations: [0, 1]
   earth_model_name: ak135-f-continental.m
   nworkers: 6
   use_crust2: false
   replace_water: false
   source_depth_min: 0.0
   source_depth_max: 35.0
   source_depth_spacing: 1.0
   source_distance_radius: 100.0
   source_distance_spacing: 1.
   error_depth: 0.1
   error_velocities: 0.1
   depth_limit_variation: 600.0
   code: psgrn
   sample_rate: 1.1574074074074073e-05
   sampling_interval: 1.0
   medium_depth_spacing: 1.0
   medium_distance_spacing: 1.0

To get a short explanation for each parameter please see the API modules `here <https://hvasbath.github.io/beat/api.html#config.NonlinearGFConfig>`__.

The variable 'store_superdir' needs to contain an **absolute path** to your $project_directory/.
You can also change the number of cores available to your system with the variable 'nworkers' to speed up the calculation of the GFs.
The GF grid spacing is important and can be modified in x,y direction with 'source_distance_spacing' and in depth with 'source_depth_spacing'.
The grid extent can be modified by 'source_distance_radius'. All the units are given in [km].

.. note:: Please keep the extent of the expected finite rectangular fault in mind! The source grid has to cover **always** the **complete** fault!. **Example**: For a fault with expected width between 10 - 15 km with, a dip of 70-90 degrees and an upper edge depth of 0-2. km; the depth grid of the GF store (including safety buffer) has to range from: 0. km to 17.5 km

The GF parameters for the 2009 L'Aquila static example are good for now.::

   beat build_gfs Laquila --datatypes=geodetic

This will create an empty Greens Function store named statics_ak135_0.000Hz_0 in the $GF_path. It will use the AK135 earth model [Kennet1995]_ . Optionally, one could decide to use CRUST2.0 [Bassin2000]_ for the shallow layers (use_crust2 flag above).
Under $GF_path/statics_ak135_0.000Hz_0/config the Green's Functions "config"-file could be further customized .

For this 2009 L'Aquila static datatype, we can next build the Green's Functions with::

   beat build_gfs Laquila --force --execute

This will take some time, depending on how much cores you specified to execute in parallel at 'nworkers'. However, this only has to be done once and
the GF store can be reused for different scenarios if the velocity model does not differ between the different cases.


Seismic
=======
In this case we will calculate a Greens Function store that holds dynamic displacements. For this we will make use of the QSSP [Wang2017]_ backend.
The station-event geometry determines the grid of Greens Functions (GFs) that will need to be calculated next.

Please open $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml with any text editor (e.g. vi) and search for "store_superdir". Here, it is written for now /home/vasyurhm/BEATS/GF, which is an example path to the directory of Greens Functions.
This path needs to be replaced with the path to where the GFs are supposed to be stored on your computer. This directory is referred to as the $GF_path in the rest of the text. It is strongly recommended to use a separate directory apart from the beat source directory and the $project_directory as the GF databases can become very large, depending on the problem! For real examples, the GF databases may require up to several Gigabyte of free disc space. For our example the databases that we are going to create for each station are only few Megabytes ( 16 each and 586 MB in total for the higher resolution for kinematic FFO).


Dependend on the case study there are crucial parameters that often need to be changed from the default values: the spatial grid dimensions, the sample rate and the wave phases (body waves and/or surface waves) to be calculated.

In the $project_path/config_geometry.yaml under seismic config we find the gf_config, which holds the major parameters for GF calculation::

  gf_config: !beat.SeismicGFConfig
    store_superdir: /home/vasyurhm/BEATS/GF
    reference_model_idx: 0
    n_variations: [0, 1]
    earth_model_name: ak135-f-continental.m
    nworkers: 4
    use_crust2: false
    replace_water: false
    source_depth_min: 0.0
    source_depth_max: 30.0
    source_depth_spacing: 4.0
    source_distance_radius: 30.0
    source_distance_spacing: 4.0
    error_depth: 0.1
    error_velocities: 0.1
    depth_limit_variation: 600.0
    code: qssp
    sample_rate: 0.5
    rm_gfs: true

Here we see that we use the global velocity model ak135 for all the stations. We could decide to use the CRUST2.0 model [Bassin2000]_ (set use_crust2: True) to replace the shallow crustal model, so that each station would have an individual velocity model depending on their location.
Below are the grid definitions of the GFs. These grid sampling parameters as well as the sample rate are of major importance for the overall optimization.
With such a setup, Greens Function stores for each station named $station_name_ak135_0.500Hz_0 are going to be created in the $GF_path.
The respective distance grid of GFs is relative to each station-event distance.

.. note:: **Example**: The event-station distance is 1000 km and source_distance_radius is set to 60 km, the resulting distance grid will be from 940 to 1060 km.

How to adjust the other parameters such as the grid spacing and the sample_rate are very problem dependend.
Rule of thumbs for setting these parameters for other individual studies are discussed `here <https://pyrocko.org/docs/current/apps/fomosto/tutorial.html#considerations-for-real-world-applications>`__.

.. note:: Please keep the extent of the expected finite rectangular fault in mind! The source grid has to cover **always** the **complete** fault!. **Example**: For a fault with expected width between 10 - 15 km with, a dip of 70-90 degrees and an upper edge depth of 0-2. km; the depth grid of the GF store (including safety buffer) has to range from: 0. km to 17.5 km

The 'nworkers' variable defines the number of CPUs to use in parallel for the GF calculations. As these calculations may become very expensive and time-consuming it is of advantage to use as many CPUs as available. To be still able to navigate in your Operating System without crashing the system it is recommended to leave at least one CPU work-less. Please edit the 'nworkers' parameter now!

For our use-case the grid specifications are fine for now.

The seismic phases for which the GFs are going to be calculated are defined under 'waveforms' in the $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml; there are ::

      - !beat.WaveformFitConfig
        include: true
        name: any_P
        blacklist: []
        channels: [Z]
        filterer: !beat.heart.Filter
          lower_corner: 0.01
          upper_corner: 0.1
          order: 3
        distances: [0.0, 9.0]
        interpolation: multilinear
        arrival_taper: !beat.heart.ArrivalTaper
          a: -20.0
          b: -10.0
          c: 250.0
          d: 270.0

In this case the GFs are going to be calculated for the P body waves as can be seen by the "name" parameter "any_P". How to calculate GFs also for S or surface waves is discussed in `Scenario 0 <https://hvasbath.github.io/beat/examples/FullMT_regional.html#calculate-greens-functions>`__.

The specifications for the Green's Functions are fine now and we can start the setup with::

  beat build_gfs Laquila --datatypes='seismic' --execute

To check if the calculated GF stores are complete please run::

  beat check Laquila --what=stores

Everything worked well if the output is like that::

  heart        - INFO     Checking stores for empty traces ...
  beat         - WARNING  Store(s) with empty traces! : []

If there are stores with empty traces please rerun::

  beat build_gfs Laquila --datatypes='seismic' --execute --force

In case the holes still persist likely the velocity model has to be adjusted.

.. note:: Please also see `Scenario 0 <https://hvasbath.github.io/beat/examples/FullMT_regional.html#calculate-greens-functions>`__ for more detailed instructions like quality control.


Optimization setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before further setup we should check that the 'project_dir' variable in the main upper body of the $project_directory/config_geometry file is set correctly to your $project_directory/.
Please also take note of the 'event' variables, which are the GCMT source parameters for the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake in the `pyrocko <https://github.com/pyrocko/pyrocko>`__. event format.
The location and timing parameters of this event are used as the reference point in the setup of the local coordinate system.
We will explore the solution space of a Rectangular Source [Okada1985]_ in an elastic homogeneously layered halfspace.

The parameters to explore are the sources east_shift, north_shift, depth, strike, rake, dip, length, width and slip.
The unit for slip is [m] and for all the other length measures (length, width, depth etc...) it is [km]. The angles (strike, dip and rake) are given in [degree].
If **seismic** data is used, also kinematic parameters as source time, duration, nucleation_x, nucleation_y are optimized for (assuming constant rupture velocity of 3.5km/s).

Often there the user has some apriori knowledge about the parameters of the Rectangular Source. These can be defined under the "priors" dictionary in the problem_config section.
Here is an example::

   priors:
     rake: !beat.heart.Parameter
       name: rake
       form: Uniform
       lower: [-180.0]
       upper: [0.0]
       testvalue: [-110.0]


.. note:: The "testvalue" has to be within the upper and lower bounds!

However, for the L'Aquila example we are now satisfied with the pre-set priors, in the config_geometry.yaml file. These are chosen with broad bounds around the reference solution, demonstrating a case where some prior knowledge is available. This allows for a faster search of the solution space.

The 'decimation_factor' variable controls how detailed the displacement from the source should be calculated.
High numbers allow for faster calculation through each forward calculation, but the accuracy will be lower.
The sub variable 'geodetic' controls the decimation for the geodetic data only.
As the datasets for the L'Aquila earthquake example consist of subsampled datasets at a low resolution, we can set the decimation_factor to 4.

Datatype specific setup options
===============================
Orbital ramps
"""""""""""""
There are additional hierarchical parameters that could be enabled in the setup of the optimization. These would be sampled in the course of the optimization as well.
For **geodetic** data this is an additional linear trend ('ramp' in InSAR terminology) to each dataset. This can be turned on and off with the variable 'fit_plane' in the geodetic_config section.

Station corrections
"""""""""""""""""""
For **seismic** data a station correction term could be optimized for, which is a time_shift of the whole waveform related to each station.
This is a reasonable option to enable to account for a time_shift caused by a poor knowledge of the velocity model.
To enable this option the parameter 'station_corrections' in the seismic_config section would need to be set to true.

Noise scalings
""""""""""""""
The residual noise estimation per default is set to each datatype. Thus an additional noise scaling parameter (Bayesian jargon in literature: hyperparameter) is added as a random variable in the setup. However, often the noise conditions for some datasets can be very different and the initial data-covariance estimations might have different quality. Therefore, it might be a reasonable option to enable the parameters 'dataset_specific_residual_noise_estimation' to estimate a noise scaling for each dataset for either datatypes. For the L'aquila case for geodetic data this option is enabled.

If you did so, the config_geometry.yaml has to be updated with the additional hierarchical parameters (ramp, time_shift).::

 beat update Laquila --parameters="hierarchicals"

If the config setup for the noise scaling parameter has been changed also the hyperparameters have to be updated.::

 beat update Laquila --parameters="hypers"

These two commands could also be executed in one line.::

 beat update Laquila --parameters="hierarchicals,hypers"


Sample the solution space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please refer to the 'Sample the solution space section' of `Scenario 0 <https://hvasbath.github.io/beat/examples/FullMT_regional.html#sample-the-solution-space>`__ scenario for a more detailed description of the sampling and associated parameters.

Firstly, we only optimize for the noise scaling or hyperparameters (HPs)::

   beat sample Laquila --hypers

Checking the $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml, the HPs parameter bounds show something like::

   hyperparameters:
   h_SAR: !beat.heart.Parameter
     name: h_SAR
     form: Uniform
     lower: [-1.0]
     upper: [5.0]
     testvalue: [2.0]

The 'n_jobs' number should be set to as many CPUs as the user can spare under the sampler_config. The number of sampled MarkovChains and the number of steps for each chain of the SMC sampler has been reduced for this example to allow for a fast result, at the cost of a more thorough exploration of the parameter space.
After the determination of the hyperparameters we can now start the sampling with::

   beat sample Laquila

.. note::  For more detailed search of the solution space please modify the parameters 'n_steps' and 'n_chains' for the SMC sampler in the $project_directory/config_geometry.yaml file to higher numbers. Depending on these specifications and the available hardware the sampling may take several hours/few days.


Summarize and plotting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After the sampling successfully finished, the final stage results have to be summarized with::

 beat summarize Laquila --stage_number=-1

After that, several figures illustrating the results can be created. To do so the **kite** software needs to be installed and the original displacement data needs to be downloaded `here <https://github.com/braunfuss/laquila_kite_container>`__. They need to be put into the specified data path given under "datadir" in the geodetic_config section of the configuration file.
For a comparison between data, synthetic displacements and residuals for the two InSAR tracks in a local coordinate system please run::

  beat plot Laquila scene_fits

The plot should show something like this. Here the residuals are displayed with an individual color scale according to their minimum and maximum values:
 .. image:: ../_static/scenario1/Laquila_scenes_-1_max_local_0.png

For a plot using the global geographic coordinate system where the residuals have the same color bar as data and synthetics please run::

  beat plot Laquila scene_fits --plot_projection=latlon

.. image:: ../_static/scenario1/Laquila_scenes_-1_max_latlon_0.png

To plot waveform fits::

  beat plot Laquila waveform_fits


.. image:: ../_static/scenario1/Laquila_waveforms_-1_max_0.png


To plot the posterior marginal distributions of the source parameters for only the final stage, please run::

  beat plot Laquila stage_posteriors --stage_number=-1


.. image:: ../_static/scenario1/Laquila_stage_-1_max.png

Here h_SAR are the noise scaling parameters for the two InSAR scenes and h_any_P_0_Z is the noise scaling for the P-phases.


For a correlation plot of the parameter marginals please run::

  beat plot LaquilaJointPonlyUPDATE correlation_hist --format=png --varnames=depth,north_shift,dip,east_shift,slip,width,time,nucleation_x,rake,nucleation_y,strike,length


.. image:: ../_static/scenario1/Laquila_corr_hist_-1_max.png

Here the "varnames" argument determines the order of the plotted variables and which variable to plot. The kinematic source parameters are only resolved by using seismic data. So for optimization results that include only **geodetic** data, the parameters time, duration, nucleation_x and nucleation_y have to be omitted.

These plots are stored under your Laquila folder under geometry/figures.
